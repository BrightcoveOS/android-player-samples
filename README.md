## Installing the sample apps
Currently, all of the sample app projects must be installed together as a bundle. Individual sample app projects also have specific dependencies. For those specific dependencies, see the individual project descriptions above for details.

To install the sample apps into Android Studio follow these steps:

1. Obtain and install the latest version of [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html) using the provided on-line instructions,
1. Configure Android Studio for Android versions from Android 10 to Android 19 (see Android Studio help for details),
1. Invoke the new project wizard using the File menu if it is not presented by default,

From Android Studio using VCS installation:

1. Select the *Checkout From Version Control* option in the new project dialog,
1. Pick the GITHUB menu entry
1. Use **https://github.com/BrightcoveOS/android-player-samples.git** for the URL
1. Click on SUBMIT and use default values on subsequent screens.

From Android Studio using Import

1. Clone this repo to your file system.
1. Select the *Import Project...* option in the new project dialog,
1. Using the file selector dialog, select the top level **build.gradle** file from the cloned repo on your system,
1. Click on OK and use default values on subsequent sceens.

Android Studio will now download/import and build the sample app.  At this point the samples will be in your instance of Android Studio where you can observe the snippets in action on a physical or virtual device, walk through the code using the Android Studio debugger, search on keywords or just browse Android source code.

## Overriding the default build behavior
By default, the sample apps will build with the most recent Brightcove Android Native Player version at build time. To override this behavior with a specific version, create a file named **.gradle/gradle.properties** in your home directory and set the value of the property *anpVersion* to the desired version.  An invalid version will cause no sample app projects to be configured.

## Building with Gradle on the command line
These sample apps now build with the latest released version of Gradle, 4.0.1. Please note that when building these apps from the command line, that the Gradle daemon is started, and will continue to run after the build completes.

To stop the daemon after the build completes, run the following:
`./gradlew --stop`

## Running a sample app
1. To run a sample app on an Android 4.2.2 or later device, plug the device into the computer and ensure that USB debugging is enabled.  Android Studio will recognize the device as long as the device identifies as running a version between Android 10 and Android 19 otherwise Android Studio will run the sample app in the simulator.  Using the simulator is not recommended as video support is buggy.  This will be resolved as Android Studio and the Android SDK mature.
1. Select a sample app from the *Run/Debug Configuration* selector and click on the run (green button) icon to start the sample.

Enjoy!
